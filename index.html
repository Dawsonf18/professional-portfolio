        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p> 
           Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I've been in love with computers, technology, and most of all, coding my whole life.
           I look at computers as beautiful machinery that give us the ability and accessability to create, innovate, and invent.
           Over the years i have acquired multiple useful skills needed in the field of software engineering. These skills include 
           html, css, react, javascript, and node js. Really understanding how each of these languages work and why they work the way 
           they do is the reason i've been able to not only build development projects from scratch, but also find and fix bugs in 
           previously built code.
        </p>
